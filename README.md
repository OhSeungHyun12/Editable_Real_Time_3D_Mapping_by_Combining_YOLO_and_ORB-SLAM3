# Real_Time_3D_map_generation_with_a_combination_of_YOLO_and_ORB_SLAM
**This project combines YOLO for object detection and ORB-SLAM for real-time SLAM to generate 3D maps.**

this project uses YOLOv11 for object detection and integrates the detected object into a 3D map built with ORB-SLAM3. The goal is to generate a high-precision 3D map that accurately represents the position, shape, and surrounding structure of the detedcted objects.
