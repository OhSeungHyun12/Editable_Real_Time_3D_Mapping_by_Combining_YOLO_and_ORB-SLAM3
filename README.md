# Real_Time_3D_map_generation_with_a_combination_of_YOLO_and_ORB_SLAM
**This project combines YOLO for object detection and ORB-SLAM for real-time SLAM to generate 3D maps.**

this project uses YOLOv11 for object detection and integrates the detected object into a 3D map built with ORB-SLAM3. The goal is to generate a high-precision 3D map that accurately represents the position, shape, and surrounding structure of the detedcted objects.

## Keyword
+  **Object Detection**

    Real-time object detection using YOLOv11.
+  Dynamic SLAM
  
    ORB-SLAM3 provides real-time camera tracking and 3D map reconstruction in dynamic environments.
+  3D Map Generation
  
    Generate high-precision 3D maps that visually represent detected objects and the surrounding terrain based on object recognition.
